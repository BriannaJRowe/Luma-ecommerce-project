WebdriverIO Assignment - Brianna Rowe
Instructions

Navigate to the root of the folder and run the command npm install.
Ensure that webdriverIO is correctly configured before attempting to execute these tests.

Note: The cart.e2e.js file should be ran by executing the command : npx wdio run wdio.conf.js OR npx wdio run wdio.conf.js --spec ./test/specs/cart.e2e.js

The sign up tests will be executed first, with the exception of the unhappy path, followed by the add to cart -> purchase a product -> verify order purchase.
To run the unhappy path please put an x before the happy path/it(should sign up a new user) e.g: 'xit(should....)'

Please let me know if there are any issues encountered.
